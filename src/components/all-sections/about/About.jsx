            Hello, my name is
            <strong> Sahil Soni</strong> and I am an experienced Full-Stack Web
            Application Engineer with 1+ of experience in web development. I
            have a strong passion for building reliable and efficient web
            applications that provide a seamless user experience. As a current
            Masters student at the University of Windsor, I have had the
            opportunity to work on numerous academic and industry projects that
            have challenged me to consistently learn and grow as a professional.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my free time, I enjoy engaging in two of my passions -
            playing chess and staying fit by going to the gym. As a dedicated
            Web Apps Engineer, I am always seeking ways to enhance my skills and
            expertise in building high-quality Web applications. I am eager to
            apply my knowledge and experience to help clients fulfill their Web
            Application needs, and I am always ready to take on new challenges.
            Thank you for visiting my website, and I am excited to connect with
            you soon!
